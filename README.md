# Android MVI Architecture - Sample App
Example Jetpack Compose Android App, that uses the newest mechanisms, like StateFlow, SharedFlow, etc. to manage states and handle events. :)
This Repo will be update soon with retrofit client, and hilt. I use koin in this repo because I'm also a new leaner of this lib but Hilt is recommended.

I'm using old file storage mechanism right now for saving screenshot, but I'll update soon. It's under development. Keep your eyes open on this repo.
